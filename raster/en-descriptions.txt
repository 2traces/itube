0	Isla de la Juventud("Isle of Youth") is the second-largest Cuban island and the sixth-largest island in the West Indies. The island has an area 3056 km² (1180 square miles) and is 100 km south of the island of Cuba, across the Gulf of Batabanó. The island lies almost directly south of Havana and Pinar del Río, and because of its superficial extension, population and for its economic characteristics, is considered to be a Special Municipality, not being a part of any province. The Isle of Youth is, therefore, administered directly by the central government of Cuba.

38	The Presidio Modelo (Model Prison) located 5km east of Nueva Gerona. It was built between 1926 & 1931 and was designed on the model of the penitentary at Joliet Illinois in the United States -- on a "panopticon" plan that called for circular buildings that put prisoners under constant surveillance. The prison was designed to house 6,000 inmates in four 5-story circular buildings. Often, many more prisoners were crammed inside. At the center of each rondel was a watchtower, with slits for viewing the prisoners. Guards could enter and leave the watchtower through underground passages and thus never came in direct contact with prisoners. A fifth circular building in the middle housed the mess hass, dubbed "The Palace of 3,000 Silences" because all talking was forbidden. Prisoners transferred to the mess hall also through underground tunnels so a prisoner had no opportunity for escape. The last prisoner went home from the Presidio in 1967 and only the shells remain. Two oblong buildings at the prison have a very special place in Cuban history. It was here in 1953 that Fidel Castro and 25 other revolutionaries were imprisoned following the attack on the Moncada barracks. Batista foolishly allowed Castro to set up a revolutionary school -- the Academia Idelogica Abel Santamaria -- where the group studied revolutionary theory and guerrilla tactics. Castro and the revolutionaries were released on May 15, 1955. The Academy and revolutionary cells have been preserved as a national monument.

252	Cayman Brac is an island that lies about 143 km northeast of Grand Cayman in the Caribbean Sea. It is about 19 km long, with an average width of 2 km. Its terrain is the most spectacular of the three Cayman Islands. "The Bluff", a massive central limestone outcrop, rises steadily along the length of the island up to 43 m above the sea at the eastern end. The island is named after this prominent feature, as Brac is a Gaelic name for a bluff. The population of the island was estimated at 1,822 in 1999.
253	Little Cayman is the smallest of the three Cayman Islands, both in area and population. It is located in the Caribbean Sea, about 87 miles northeast of Grand Cayman and five miles west of Cayman Brac. Little Cayman has a permanent population of less than 170 and is less than ten square miles in area, about ten miles long and one mile wide. Most of the island is at sea level. The highest elevation is about 40 feet. Little Cayman is famous for its scuba diving. The most famous dive sites, Bloody Bay Wall and Jackson's Bight, are both located on the northwest end of the island. Bloody Bay Wall is consistently ranked as one of the world's top wall dives with the ocean floor dropping off from a depth of 15 feet to 5000 feet almost vertically. Little Cayman is accessible by air (via Cayman Airways) and water from Cayman Brac. Little Cayman has one store, several restaurants, an airport, post office, a fire station, and one church. Little Cayman also has a visitor center for its red-footed booby pond, the largest red-footed booby population in the Caribbean and a designated Ramsar wetland of international importance. Another important species present on Little Cayman is the endangered Turks and Caicos rock iguana. Little Cayman also has its own airport called Edward Bodden Airfield. The first recorded sighting of Little Cayman, along with Cayman Brac, was by Christopher Columbus on May 10, 1503 on his fourth and final voyage, when heavy winds forced his ship off course. At that time, he named the islands "Las Tortugas" for the many sea turtles found living there. The islands were later renamed "Las Caymanas" for the caimans living there. Since its discovery, Little Cayman has continued to support a small seasonal population of around 200 people. The first settlement on the island was in the 17th century, when turtle fishermen set up camps. After a raid by a Spanish privateer, the settlements were abandoned in 1671 and the island was not resettled until 1833, when Blossom Village was established by a few families. By the early 20th century, a few hundred people lived on Little Cayman and exported phosphate ore, coconuts, and marine rope. Little Cayman, along with the other Cayman Islands, is now a British dependancy.
254	This is a 73 ha nature park for endangered smaragd green parrots. The nature park came in existent by National Trust in 1996. The last survey did count 400 parrots. In the nature park there are also 38 different trees, palms, cacti, agaves and orchids.

698	Used by the United States Navy for more than a century, and is the oldest overseas U.S. Navy Base. The United States controls the land on both sides of the southern part of Guantánamo Bay (Bahía de Guantánamo in Spanish) under a lease set up in the wake of the 1898 Spanish-American War. The current Cuban government considers the U.S. presence in Guantánamo to be an illegal occupation of the area, and argues that the Cuban-American Treaty, which established the lease in 1903, now violates article 52 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The United States bases its current legal claim on the base to the fact that the Castro regime cashed two annual lease checks shortly after they came to power. the U.S. states that since they cashed the checks, the new regime was willing to abide by the original lease agreement. They have not cashed subsequent checks, which are still sent annually. It is the only United States military installation located in a Communist country. Since 2001, the naval base has contained a military prison, the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp, for persons alleged to be militant combatants captured in Afghanistan and later in Iraq. www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/guantanamo-bay...
703	The camp primarily consists of Camp America on the west, the Camp Delta complex in the center and Camp Echo to the east. Note that Camp No and Camp Seven are within a mile to the northwest. www.springercartographics.com/camp-delta-guantanamo-bay...

754	For years Cuban workers lined up and walked across to work on the base as day laborers. In 2006, only two elderly Cubans still crossed the base's North East Gate daily to work on the base; the Cuban government prohibits new recruitment. This brings some people memories of Berlin wall, since this is the only place where one can cross between two territories controled by a capitalistic state and a socialist one, (as North Korea has closed the only other). Guantánamo Bay is still legally Cuban territory under the Platt amendment (which gave the US control over it).
