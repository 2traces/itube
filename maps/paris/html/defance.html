		<h3>A Forest of Towers</h3>
		<p class="first-letter">F</p>
		<p>irst conceived in 1958, this Modernist suburb just west of Paris was inspired by Le Corbusier's dream of high-rise buildings, pedestrian walkways, and sunken vehicle circulation. Built as an experiment to keep high-rises out of the historic downtown, the Parisian business hub has survived economic uncertainty to become a surprising success.</p> 
		<div class="note">Besides the representative architecture, the area also houses around sixty statues and pieces of modern art including works of Joan Miró, Alexander Calder, Takis, a piece of the Berlin Wall, César, and others</div>
		<p>Visiting La Défense gives you a crash course in contemporary skyscraper evolution, from the solid blocks of the 1960s and '70s to the curvy fins of the '90s and beyond. Today 20,000 people live in the suburb, but 150,000 people work here, and many more come to shop in its enormous mall. While riding the métro Line 1 here, you'll get a view of the Seine, then emerge at a pedestrian plaza studded with some great public art, including César's giant thumb and one of Calder's great red "stabiles." The Grande Arche de La Défense dominates the area: it was designed as a controversial closure to the historic axis of Paris (an imaginary line that runs through the Arc de Triomphe, the Arc du Carrousel, and the Louvre Pyramide). Glass bubble elevators in a metal-frame tower whisk you a heart-jolting 360 feet to the viewing platform.</p>
