				<h1>Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle</h1>
				<p>Magnificent, varied floral beds make a fine approach to the collection of buildings that form the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle. Skip the musty museums of paleontology, anatomy, mineralogy, entomology and paleobotany in favour of the Grande Galerie de l’Evolution (daily except Tues 10am–6pm; e8), housed in a dramatically restored nineteenth-century glass-domed building (the entrance is off rue Buffon).You can’t fail to be wowed by the sheer scale of the interior, where the story of evolution and the relations between human beings and nature is told with the aid of stuffed animals (rescued from the dusty old zoology museum and restored to such spruceness that they look alive) and a combination of clever lighting effects, ambient music and birdsong, videos and touch-screen databases. If you really want to do something as old-fashioned as reading, there are wooden lecture boards in English to accompany the aurals and visuals. On the lower level, submarine light suffuses the space where the murkiest deep-ocean creatures are displayed.Above, glass lifts rise silently from the savannah, where a closely packed line of huge African animals, headed by an elephant, look as if they’re stepping onto Noah’s ark. It’s all great fun for children, and there’s even a small interactive centre for kids on the first floor.</div>
