		<h3>The two founders nicknamed the entire endeavour ‘The First Palace of Women’</h3>

		<p>he Moulin Rouge opened in 1899, on the cusp of a new century and amid the atmosphere of excitement and progress that had been engendered by the construction of the groundbreaking Eiffel Tower in the same year. The Industrial Revolution in France was smashing social barriers and encouraging a new, less rigid kind of class system, and it was in this modern era of loose definitions and morals that the Moulin Rouge was to carve itself into the decadent fabric of the new liberal Parisian society. Upon its official opening on the 6th October the theatre was established as an extravagant and wild home for music hall entertainment, and the Moulin Rouge has clung on to this reputation and evoked the spirit of the Belle Époque decades ever since.</p>
		<div class="note">The ingredients for its success:

   * A revolutionary architecture for the auditorium that allowed rapid changes of décor and where everyone could mix;
   * Festive champagne evenings where people danced and were entertained thanks to amusing acts that changed regularly, such as the Pétomane;
   * A new dance inspired by the quadrille which becomes more and more popular: The Can-can, danced to a furious rhythm by dancers in titillating costumes;
   * Famous dancers whom history still remembers: la Goulue, Jane Avril, la Môme Fromage, Grille d'Egout, Nini Pattes en l'Air, Yvette Guilbert ;
   * A place loved by artists, of whom the most iconic was Toulouse-Lautrec. His posters and paintings secured rapid and international fame for the Moulin Rouge.

		<p>The theatre was built by Joseph Oller, a Spanish entrepreneur who later opened Paris’ first music hall, the Olympia. Charles Zidler was his business partner and the manager of the theatre, and together they set out to create a place that would cater for the changing tastes of the public in the new Belle Époque era, imagining a venue where classes could mingle side by side and specialising in an over the top kind of luxury that could be enjoyed by all. These aims were borne out in the extravagant quirks that characterised the theatre, such as the gigantic elephant in the garden, the glitzy whirling windmill on the roof or the plush interior. The two businessmen nicknamed the entire endeavour ‘Le Premier Palais des Femmes’, or ‘The First Palace of Women’
Since its debut performances the Moulin Rouge has hosted and created stars from the worlds of music hall, dance and singing. In its formative years the theatre was defined by the personalities on its stage, from Queen of the Can-Can and Toulouse-Lautrec’s muse La Goulue, to the creator of music hall Mistinguett and the blazing star Edith Piaf, who first found fame on the stage of the Moulin Rouge (as well as love in the form of singer Yves Montand). In later years a number of famous French artists and singers would grace the stage, including Charles Trénet and Bourvil, and many world renowned artists have performed at the theatre including Ginger Rogers, Lauren Bacall, Ray Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Juliette Binoche and Elton John.
