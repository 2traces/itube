					<p class="text_full"><span class="head_block">Louvre <br>collection</span><span class="header_two"></span><br><br>To the south and east of the Pyramide entrance are galleries displaying early Renaissance sculpture in the Denon Wing. Don't skip the coat checks on the ground floor of the Denon or Richelieu wings—much of the museum is hot and stuffy. Walk up the marble Escalier Daru to discover the sublime Winged Victory of Samothrace , a statue found on a tiny Greek island that was carved in 305 BC to commemorate the naval victory of Demetrius Poliocretes over the Turks. In the paintings section of the Denon Wing, you'll find three by Leonardo da Vinci, including the most famous painting in the world: the Mona Lisa , located in Salle 7. Head across to Salle 75 for the Coronation of Napoléon, or to Salle 77 for the graphic 1819 Raft of the Medusa, the first work of art based on a real news event, in this case the survivors of the wreck of a French ship. <br><br>To save time, avoid the main entrance at the Pyramide and head for the entrance in the underground mall, Carrousel du Louvre, which has automatic ticket machines, or to the Porte de Lions entrance (closed Friday) on the southwestern corner. Ticket-holders can come and go through the Porte Richelieu on the rue de Rivoli side. If you need a break, there are several cafés within the museum, including Café Richelieu, run by the upscale confiseur Angelina; or hold onto your ticket (you can reenter all day) and pop out to one of the open-air cafés in the Jardin de Tuileries. The shortest lines tend to be around 9:30 am and 1 pm. Crowds are also thinner on Wednesday and Friday nights, when the museum is open late. Remember that the Louvre is closed Tuesday.<br><br></p></div>
