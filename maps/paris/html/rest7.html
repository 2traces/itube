				<h1>Antoine Westermanns “Brasserie Deluxe”</h1>
				<p>“The Drouant has helped me actualize my vision of a deluxe brasserie with an informal atmosphere and excellent cuisine; a reasonably priced unpretentious establishment where everyone feels comfortable.” These words spoken by Antoine Westermann, the creator of Drouant, have an almost revolutionary spin to them due to the nature of his background; his restaurant Buerehiesel in Strasbourg received three Michelin stars in the 90’s. Tables filled to capacity demonstrate how well he understands the spirit of the times and that he knows how to keep his patrons happy, even after voluntarily leaving the fine dining industry. One thing that patrons find particularly pleasing is this restaurant’s close vicinity to the opera; another is the ambience that (in keeping with the spirit of the times and this address’ tradition) picks up on the art déco construction, which has allured artists and intellectuals since the beginning of the 20th century. The special events organized at Drouant have also captured the spirit of the times; whether it be the “petit trainard” Sunday brunch, a taste sensation for 32 euros, or the wine suppers with the winery owner and specially created menus on Saturday nights. Younger guests love the carefully designed children’s menu, and older patrons love the huge freedom the menu offers.  Its various categories consist of the best seasonal products prepared in such a way that is most flattering to them. <br><br><a href="preview://img/r7-1.jpg"><img src="img/r7-1.jpg" class="type1-img1"><br><br><a href="preview://img/r7-2.jpg"><img src="img/r7-2.jpg" class="type1-img1"> </div>
