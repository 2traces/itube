				<h1>Ambassador of Lebanese cuisine</h1>
				<p>Not far away from the Champs-Élysées in the Al-Ajami restaurant – one can experience all the culinary charm and magic of the orient. The restaurant ambiance, with its 1001 Night charm visually sets the mood for all the delicacies and refined gastronomic pleasures which Lebanon has to offer. The host family Abou Chalbak, who also have a restaurant in Beirut under the same name, are especially proud of their 88 year long restaurant history. The Paris Al-Ajami has since become an institution, whose exquisite, authentic cuisine (all dishes are traditional family recipes) is not only loved by Arab-speaking French, but also by well known by artists, actors and politicians. In order to experience the variety of Lebanese cuisine, one must simply order the degustation menu or the “mezze-discoveries” with its 9 to 12 different dishes. Whether it’s hummus: the famous chickpea puree, tabbouleh, the bulgur and parsley salad with lemon juice and olive oil, halloum, the sheep cheese with anis, or moujadra, the delicious mousse made out of lentils and olive oil – at the Al-Ajami, guests are ensured culinary sensations. And with a bottle of Lebanese red wine, the evening is perfect. The price/service ratio is also sure to please. <br><br><a href="preview://img/r9-1.jpg"><img src="img/r9-1.jpg" class="type1-img1"><br><br><a href="preview://img/r9-2.jpg"><img src="img/r9-2.jpg" class="type1-img1"> </div>
