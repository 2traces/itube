				<h1>Institut du Monde Arabe</h1>
				<p>This eye-catching metal-and-glass tower by architect Jean Nouvel cleverly uses metal diaphragms in the shape of square Arabic-style screens to work like a camera lens, opening and closing to control the flow of sunlight. The vast cultural center's layout is intended to reinterpret the traditional enclosed Arab courtyard. Inside, there are various spaces—among them a museum, inaugurated in 2012, that explores the culture and religion of the 22 Arab League member nations. With the addition of elements from the Louvre's holdings and private donors, the museum's impressive collection includes Islamic art, artifacts, ceramics, and textiles, which are displayed on four floors. There is also a performance space, a sound-and-image center, a library, and a bookstore. Temporary exhibitions usually have information and an audioguide in English. Glass elevators whisk you to the ninth floor, where you can sip mint tea in the rooftop café, Le Ziryab, while feasting on one of the best views in Paris.<img src="img/71.jpg" alt="" class="type1-img1"/><br><br>A sleek permanent museum begins on the seventh floor, using an array of exquisite artefacts to trace the evolution of the arts and sciences in the Islamic world. The topmost level, dedicated to pre-Islamic finds, is somewhat surprising, as the Carthaginian sculptures and pottery display a distinctly Roman influence, while a beautiful seventh- century Tunisian mosaic hails from an early church. One floor down, brass celestial globes, astrolabes, compasses and sundials illustrate the cutting-edge Arab research that so influenced the West in the Middle Ages, along with illustrated manuscripts, weights and measures, and the grinding and mixing implements for medicines. But the museum’s treasures are kept on the lowest floor, with exquisitely crafted ceramics, metalwork and carpets from all over the Muslim world – from Spain to Central Asia.<br><br>On other levels there are a library and multimedia centre for scholars, a space for temporary exhibitions, a specialist bookshop that sells good Arab music CDs, and an auditorium for regular films and concerts, often featuring leading performers from the Arab world. Up on the ninth floor, the terrace offers brilliant views over the Seine towards the apse of Notre-Dame. At the adjacent café-restaurant you can drink mint tea and nibble on cakes; for something more substantial there’s the self-service restaurant Le Moucharabieh where you can tuck into a plate of couscous while marvelling at the aperture action of the windows.</p>
