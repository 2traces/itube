				<h1>Artistic Flair</h1>
				<p>A restaurant, whose menu is a joy to read: tartar of duck with pineapple and quail eggs; suprême of guinea fowl with salmon mousse and green asparagus; veal medallions with polenta and lobster sauce and risotto with vanilla milk and salted caramel for dessert. The pleasure is even heightened by the presentation done by Emmanuel Gomez. The cusinier from La Petite Cour has a fable for artificial optics. This can be seen in his alluring sardines marinated a la citronelle with raspberries and vintage balsamico: The sardines are rolled into tiny barrels and filled with raspberries. These are then given a dollop of balsamico and fine, long-stemed mushrooms that stick out like the feelers of a snail. The interior design is equally refined. The framed, cream-coloured ceilings have been lacquered to such a brilliant extent, that they mirror the niches and corners of the restaurant below. The chairs are dark red and the cushions for the seating banks hang from the walls like red aprons. The theme of art is always present: Le Petite Cour is also a modern art gallery where works are shown and the terrace is known to be one of the most cosy ones in Paris. The restaurant and terrace are below street level and surrounded by rose-covered stone walls. Arriving by car is also not a problem. One must simply park at the Marché St. Germain.<br><br><a href="preview://img/r15-1.jpg"><img src="img/r15-1.jpg" class="type1-img1"><br><br><a href="preview://img/r15-2.jpg"><img src="img/r15-2.jpg" class="type1-img1"> </div>
