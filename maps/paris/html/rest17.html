				<h1>The “most Parisian” restaurant in Paris</h1>
				<p>Whoever has not seen the Relais Plaza has not seen Paris. Since 1936, the Relais Plaza has been a part of Paris in the same way as the Seine and the Eiffel Tower. It is quite simply an institution that has not fallen out of favour for decades and which has been described by Figaro as "the most Parisian restaurant" in Paris. What might be the reason for this? Perhaps the original Art Deco ambience, the initial inspiration for which was drawn from the famous SS Liner Normandie, and the fact that any guest here feels as if he has stepped into a film set? Perhaps the urbane hospitality, the mark of 30 years‘ dedication of maitre d’ Werner Küchler and his incomparable team? Perhaps it is due to the artistic flair that can be felt here? For it is not just original works of art that can be marvelled at here. The jazz evenings that take place on the last Wednesday of the month, with Werner Küchler himself taking up the microphone, have long become legendary. And, last but not least, the outstanding cuisine – the product of the genius of none less than master chef Alain Ducasse – could perhaps provide an explanation for the phenomenon that is the Relais Plaza. Head chef Philippe Marc allows only the very finest of produce into his kitchen and he produces almost everything here himself. A particular favourite of guests, leading to scrambling matches by any number of celebrities today as yesterday, are the dishes served at table such as steak tartare and spit-roast Bresse chicken.<br><br><a href="preview://img/r17-1.jpg"><img src="img/r17-1.jpg" class="type1-img1"><br><br><a href="preview://img/r17-2.jpg"><img src="img/r17-2.jpg" class="type1-img1"> </div>
