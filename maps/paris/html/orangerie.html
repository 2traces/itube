				<h1>Musée de l'Orangerie</h1>
				<p>Originally designed to protect the Tuileries’ orange trees, and now housing a private art collection including eight of Monet’s giant waterlily paintings. It reopened in 2006 after six years of renovations designed to bring Monet’s masterpieces “back into the light”. In the 1960s a concrete ceiling had been added to accommodate a new storey; this has now been removed and once again the natural light illumines the waterlilies – exactly how Monet wished them to be seen.These vast, mesmerizing canvases were executed in the last years of the artist’s life, a period when he almost obses- sively painted the pond in his garden at Giverny, attempting to capture the fleeting light and changing colours. <br><br>On the lower floor of the museum is an excellent collection of paintings by Monet’s contemporaries. Highlights include some Cézanne still lifes, portraits and landscapes, among them Le Rocher Rouge, one of the artist’s finest mature works, where the intense colours seem to vibrate and shimmer, rendering the heat of a Provençal summer almost palpable. Renoir is represented by some gardens
 sensuous nudes and touching studies of children, such as Jeunes filles au piano, the two girls’ rapt concentration on the music wonderfully conveyed. There are some fine works by Picasso and Matisse; the latter’s Les Trois Soeurs stands out for its striking portrayal of three women, the simplicity of line and colour reminiscent of a Japanese print. Much space is devoted to works by Derain, including some iridescent nudes and vibrant landscapes, and a room is given over to the more expressionistic canvases of Soutine.</p>
