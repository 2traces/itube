		<h3>Travelling by métro puts you into closer contact with Parisians than you’re likely to get anywhere else. As soon as you set foot below ground, greater Paris’s true ethnic and social mix is instantly apparent – the old working-class men, the women in West African dress and the kids from the banlieue, so conspicuously absent from the posh boulevards.</h3>
		<p class="first-letter">P</p><p>hysically, the métro just isn’t like other subways, starting with the rubber wheels that make central journeys so smooth and quiet. Then there’s the way that stations are sometimes so close that you can see people waiting at the next platform down the line, the antisocial spacing of the platform seating, and the mania for double- or treble-barrelled station names like “Maubert-Mutualité” or “Maisons-Alfort-les-Juillottes”. The best stations have distinct characters: check out the funky multicoloured lamps at Bonnes Nouvelles station, or the cabinets of treasures in Palais Royal-Musée du Louvre.</p>

The métro even has its own style and courtesy culture. You’re just supposed to know instinctively when it gets too crowded to remain seated in the wonderfully named strapontins, the folding seats by the doors. It takes a little longer to learn the effortlessly Parisian flick of the wrist that lifts that little steel lever and opens the doors.</p><p>
Travelling by métro puts you into closer contact with Parisians than you’re likely to get anywhere else. As soon as you set foot below ground, greater Paris’s true ethnic and social mix is instantly apparent – the old working-class men, the women in West African dress and the kids from the banlieue, so conspicuously absent from the posh boulevards. And every new immigrant group fleeing the latest conflict zone sends a wave of buskers down the tunnels. For tourists, the best things about the métro are its reliability – most of the four and a half million journeys a day pass without event, except when there’s a strike – and its cost: roughly two-thirds of the ticket price is subsidized by the French taxpayer.</p>
