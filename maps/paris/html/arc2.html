		<h3>the Grande Arche closes the western axis of this monumental east–west vista and is cleverly positioned at a slight angle so as to allow an uninterrupted view all the way to the Louvre’s Cour Carré.</h3>
		<p class="first-letter">A</p>
		<p> mini Manhattan of towering glass and concrete blocks, La Défense, just west of the city, is Paris’s prestige business district. Its most dazzling sight is La Grande Arche, built in 1989 to mark the bicentenary of the Revolution. This beautiful and astounding structure, a 112-metre hollow cube clad in white marble, is a conscious echo of the Arc de Triomphe, visible 6km away at the far end of the Voie Triomphale; the Grande Arche closes the western axis of this monumental east–west vista and is cleverly positioned at a slight angle so as to allow an uninterrupted view all the way to the Louvre’s Cour Carré. The only thing that slightly mars the grace of the arch is a fibreglass “cloud” canopy, suspended within its hollow, large enough to enclose Notre-Dame with ease. The architect was a little-known Danish professor, Johann Otto von Spreckelsen, whose previous projects amounted to no more than three churches and a house, and who tragically died before the arch’s completion.</p>

		<p>The arch houses a government ministry,international businesses,an information centre on the European Union and, in the roof section, the Fondation Internationale des Droits de l’Homme, which stages exhibitions and conferences on issues related to human rights. Transparent lift shafts make for a thrilling ride to the top. The lift, however, is pricey, and the views no more impressive than from the series of steps that leads up to the base of the arch, itself a popular meeting and viewing point – on a clear day, you can scan from the marble path on the parvis below you to the Arc de Triomphe, and beyond to the Louvre.</p>
		<p>From the Grande Arche to the river extends the main artery of La Défense, the pedestrianized Esplanade du Général de Gaulle, bristling with shiny office towers, apartment blocks and modern artworks. It has to be said, however, that fifty years on from its beginnings, and despite such sleek edifices as the EDF building on place de la Défense, the district is starting to look a little tired – a widely recognized fact that has prompted a major facelift and a new wave of building. Foremost among the projects is the Tour Phare, a three-hundred- metre-high gleaming, sinuous skyscraper which is due to be completed in 2012 and is the brainchild of top American architect Thomas Mayne. It will rival the Eiffel Tower in height and is designed to match buildings such as London’s “Gherkin”. It’s also notable for its green credentials – it will have a wind farm on top of its roof and a “double skin” around it which will reduce the heat from direct sunlight through the windows.</p>
