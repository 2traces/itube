			<h3>a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.</h3>
			<p class="first-letter">T</p>
			<p>he design of the Eiffel Tower was originated by Maurice Koechlin and Ã‰mile Nouguier, two senior engineers who worked for the Compagnie des Etablissements Eiffel after discussion about a suitable centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a World's Fair which would celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution.</p>
			<div class="note">The projected tower had been a subject of some controversy, attracting criticism both from those who did not believe that it was feasible and also..</div>
			<p>In May 1884 Koechlin, working at his home, made an outline drawing of their scheme, described by him as "a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals".[11] Initially Eiffel himself showed little enthusiasm, but he did sanction further study of the project, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design.</p>
			<p>Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base, a glass pavilion to the first level and other embellishments. This enhanced version gained Eiffel's support, and he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name.</p>
