				<h1>Via-à-vis the Paris Stock Exchange</h1>
				<p>The Gallopin is a small gem belonging to the Parisian tavern culture and an institution in its own right. Its founder Gustave Gallopin opened it in 1876 and showed that he had a keen sense for the spirit of the age. Today, the Alexandre family, whose fine sense of French culture has enabled them to bring back the lustre of yesteryear, operates the brasserie. As in the old days, the clientele is a colourful international and intellectual crowd. Next to bankers and stockbrokers, this traditional brasserie also attracts numerous guests from the media- fashion- and show business world. The meals prepared by Didier Piateck are classic and traditional. Here, one can meet for a business lunch or an ample dinner. One can also try the house specialty of beef tartar, which is prepared on a silver service wagon and accompanied with pommes frites and a green salad, or the beef fillet with sauce béarnaise. Interesting as well are the dishes, which were especially produced for the brasserie. The garland design that decorates the edges of the plates can also be found on the painted ceiling of the restaurant. Guests can also enjoy some of the superb wines that are also sold by the glass. Thanks to the completely new wine dispenser, opened bottles are kept closed by vacuum seals without loss of quality, meaning that now even more expensive wines can be sold by the glass. The Gallopin crowd is enthusiastic.<br><br><a href="preview://img/r5-1.jpg"><img src="img/r5-1.jpg" class="type1-img1"><br><br><a href="preview://img/r5-2.jpg"><img src="img/r5-2.jpg" class="type1-img1"> </div>
