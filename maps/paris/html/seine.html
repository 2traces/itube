		<p>eferred to by some as Paris’s main avenue or the city’s 21st arrondissement – and by others as a murky, polluted waterway – the Seine is integral to Paris, sashaying through its centre in a broad arc, taking in the capital’s grandest monuments on its way. It even makes its way into the city’s coat of arms, which depicts a ship sailing on choppy waters accompanied by the words fluctuat nec mergitur – “it is tossed about but does not sink”, a singularly apt motto for a city that has weathered events as turbulent as the French Revolution and the Commune.</p>
		<p>The Seine brought the city into being and was for centuries its lifeblood, a major conduit of trade and commerce. Floods, however, have always been a regular hazard, sometimes sweeping away bridges, houses and lives. One of the worst recorded was in 1176, when the city was almost completely engulfed. The construction of the quais in the nineteenth century helped to alleviate the problem and these tree-lined walkways have today become one of Paris’s major assets – attractive and leafy havens from the city’s bustle. Traffic is banned from a large section of the Right Bank quai on Sundays, making way for cyclists, rollerbladers and strollers, and each summer since 2002 tonnes of sand have been imported to create a kind of Paris-sur-Mer on the quais, complete with palm trees and deckchairs.</p>
