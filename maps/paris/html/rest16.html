				<h1>Dine in style under the glitter of the stars</h1>
				<p>Situated on the roof of the Kenzo headquarters and facing the historical Pont Neuf, this extraordinary and sought after venue was created seven years ago by star designer Philippe Starck and Kong founder Laurent Taïeb, and has become a hub of the stylish Parisian in-crowd. Both the Victorian-style glass dome on the sixth floor, as well as the fifth floor beneath, offer a stunning view onto the Seine, the Rue Dauphine and the Saint Sulpice church. Snazzy, brash and colourful, the décor merges design details from the West and Far East – geisha heads adorn the chair backs and the translucent room partitions. The plates are filled with fresh and tasty delicacies from around the world – cross over cuisine which borrows from Japan, Asia and the best of the Mediterranean. From a delicious lunch, via a range of coffee specialities and hip cocktail creations, to a full evening multi-course dinner – Kong caters for every occasion and every desire. And what's more: the hours go by, the prices stay the same – even in the evening. A candlelit dinner beneath the star-filled dome is an unforgettable experience, and not just for sworn romantics. Advance booking required. A DJ and musical theme to go with the food accompany the guest throughout the day. You can even order your favourite song to go along with your favourite food. 
By the way: Kong welcomes smokers. In the magical and recently opened terrace gallery with typically French Louis décor, the roof can be opened when the weather is good. Smoking is welcomed there even when the roof is closed. <br><br><a href="preview://img/r16-1.jpg"><img src="img/r16-1.jpg" class="type1-img1"><br><br><a href="preview://img/r16-2.jpg"><img src="img/r16-2.jpg" class="type1-img1"> </div>
