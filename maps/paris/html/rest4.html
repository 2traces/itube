				<h1>À la Michel Rostang</h1>
				<p>“Dessirier was the name of the founding family”, according to Philippe Judéaux, the restaurant manager, “and because of their roots in Paris and Brittany, they opened a café and oyster bar here in 1883.” It then developed into a brasserie, but when star chef and restaurateur Michel Rostang took over the establishment, it had already fallen into a state of disrepair. Rostang invested, renovated and ensured that it made a come back as one of the finest brasseries in Paris. The interior is elegant; Rostang is determined to give his patrons the service and cuisine they expect from him, which means spoiling them on an elaborate scale. First on the agenda: seafood.  Monsieur Judéaux says: “Dessirier has always been famous for the best oysters in Paris, and this is still true today.” That is not all, however. The half a Brittany lobster à la Parisienne (photo), the sea bass carpaccio, the crab salad, etc. are also popular appetizers. The house specialty, a whole turbot, gilthead, or Saint-Pierre fish for two or three people are also in high demand; guests take pleasure in simply watching as they are skillfully filleted at the table. French classics are served as the Plat du Jour ranging from wild duck to calf’s kidney, and desserts, like the mille feuille “Dessirier” or the soufflé du jour, are simply a must.<br><br><a href="preview://img/r4-1.jpg"><img src="img/r4-1.jpg" class="type1-img1"><br><br><a href="preview://img/r4-2.jpg"><img src="img/r4-2.jpg" class="type1-img1"> </div>
