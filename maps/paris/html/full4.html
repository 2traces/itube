				<h1>Shakespeare bookstore</h1>
				<p>Time has not sundered the love-in between literature and Paris's Left Bank. The Shakespeare and Company bookstore, has long been a fixture of the affair. The original shop, which doubled as a library, publisher and boarding house for aspiring writers, was opened by American Sylvia Beach and was featured in Ernest Hemingway's memoir, A Moveable Feast. The store closed during World War II, and was reopened in its current incarnation in 1951 by George Whitman, whose daughter, Sylvia (named after Beach), runs things today. Out front, bookstands surround an ornate drinking fountain, erected in the 19th century to service the area's poor. Inside, there's an extensive stock of second-hand books. When you're done browsing, retire with reading matter to the nearby restaurant Le Procope.

The sumptuous set menu (â‚¬46 for three courses) is dubbed "The Philosophes."<br><br><a href="preview://img/213b.jpg"><img src="img/213b.jpg" class="type1-img1"><br><br><a href="preview://img/213c.jpg"><img src="img/213c.jpg" class="type1-img1"></div>
