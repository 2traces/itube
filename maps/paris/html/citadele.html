		<h3>The Conciergerie prison, also known as the "antechamber to the guillotine", became the central penitentiary of a network of prisons throughout Paris, and was the final stop of over 2,700 people who were summarily executed by guillotine. </h3>
		<p class="first-letter">M</p>
		<p>ost of the Ile de la Cité's medieval structures fell victim to wunderkind planner Baron Haussmann's ambitious rebuilding program of the 1860s. Among the rare survivors are the jewel-like Sainte-Chapelle, a vision of shimmering stained glass, and the Conciergerie, the former prison where Marie-Antoinette and other victims of the French Revolution spent their final days.</p>
		<p>Constructed by Philip IV in the late13th and early14th centuries, the Conciergerie—which takes its name from the building's concierge or keeper—was part of the original palace of the kings of France, before the royals moved into the Louvre around 1364. In 1391, it became a prison. During the French Revolution, Marie-Antoinette languished 76 days here awaiting her date with the guillotine. There is a re-creation of the doomed queen's sad little cell—plus others that are far smaller—complete with wax figures behind bars. In the chapel, stained glass, commissioned after the queen's death by her daughter, is emblazoned with the initials M. A. Outside you can see the small courtyard where women prisoners took meals and washed their clothes in the fountain (men enjoyed no similar respite). Well-done temporary exhibitions on the ground floor aim to please kids and adults alike; previous themes have included enchanted forests and Gothic castles. There are free guided tours (in French only) most days at 11 and 3.</p>
