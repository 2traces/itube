				<h1>French cuisine with tradition</h1>
				<p>Opened in 1912 by Benoit Matray, the restaurant soon established itself as a first-class address. It was a location bursting with life where guests could look forward to enjoying a warm-hearted and spacious atmosphere. On acquiring the Benoit in April 2005, Alain Ducasse was determined to preserve the characteristic bistro tradition of the establishment while at the same time adding those essential modern elements. Walking through the swing doors of the restaurant, you enter into the typical Parisian world of Benoit’s bistros featuring tiled panelling, copper-red velvet benches, engraved glazing and pillars painted in marble effect. Guests wanting a little more privacy can welcome their friends in a separate lounge on the upper floor. Here in this warm and social atmosphere, the chef, David Rathgeber, lets his guests discover typically French dishes. “Snails with Garlic and Herb Butter”, “Cassoulet Speciality with Beans”, “Cream Puff a la Benoit” … to complement this wonderful cuisine, the wine list features the kind of vintages from France’s largest wine-growing areas that have made France so famous.<br><br><a href="preview://img/r1-1.jpg"><img src="img/r1-1.jpg" class="type1-img1"><br><br><a href="preview://img/r1-2.jpg"><img src="img/r1-2.jpg" class="type1-img1"> </div>
