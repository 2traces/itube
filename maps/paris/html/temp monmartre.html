		<h3>Since Montmartre was outside the city limits, free of Paris taxes and no doubt also due to the fact that the local nuns made wine, the hill quickly became a popular drinking area.</h3>
		<p class="first-letter">S</p>
		<p>itting atop a hill overlooking the city, Montmartre has always stood apart from the rest of Paris. Legend has it that in AD287, the Romans decapitated St-Denis, first bishop of Paris, on the site of the Chapelle du Martyr. St Denis calmly picked up his head and carried it to where the basilica of St Denis now stands. The village of Montmartre (‘martyr’s mount’) was not incorporated into the city boundaries until 1860. Today its most striking symbol is the Sacré-Cœur basilica, begun after France’s defeat in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, and completed in 1914. In 1871, Montmartre saw the start of the Paris Commune, when the Montmartrois, led by Louise Michel, stood up to the right-wing government of Adolphe Thiers.</p>
		<div class="note">At the end of the 19th century, artists, including Toulouse-Lautrec, began settling in the district and depicting its bars and cabarets. Suzanne Valadon (and later her son Maurice Utrillo) had her studio in the entrance lodge of what is now the Musée de Montmartre.</div>
		<p>In the early 20th-century, Montmartre nurtured the birth of Cubism, when Pablo Picasso painted Les Demoiselles d’Avignon in his studio in the Bateau Lavoir. At 22 rue des Saules, stands the legendary cabaret, Au Lapin Agile, the HQ of the avant-garde in the 1900s. Here, Renoir and Paul Verlaine laid tables, and Guillaume Apollinaire sang with fellow Surrealist poet Max Jacob. By the 1920s most artists had moved across the river to Montparnasse, where rents were lower, but numerous studio buildings remained, and some are still occupied by artists today. Pay tribute to Truffaut, Guitry, Dumas fils, Dalida, Berlioz, Degas and more in the shady groves of the Cimitière de Montmartre, on avenue Rachel. Opposite the Lapin Agile, look out for the city’s last surviving vineyard, the tiny Clos de Montmartre, which produces a wine that reputedly ‘makes you jump like a goat’.</p>
		<p>Nowadays, place du Tertre sadly abounds in overpriced tourist bistros, gift shops and bad would-be artists. Leave the hordes on the square and strike out into the Butte’s backstreets, many of which are still villagey, sheltering gorgeous ivy-clad cottages, cobbled squares and good, atmospheric eateries.</p><p>
At first blush, Paris's Montmartre neighborhood might seem little more than a sad neon strip, lined with peddlers of souvenir windmills. But idle away a few hours in its intricate back streets and you'll likely find more local color than you would in the center of Paris. Trace the maple-dappled paths of Montmartre Cemetery to the resting places of the old avant garde — Edgar Degas, Gustave Moreau and Francis Picabia lie here, amongst the more obscure departed. Climb or ride the cable car up the hill to the Basilique du Sacré-Coeur de Montmartre. Built to cure the country's spiritual ills in the face of military defeat at the hands of Germany, the basilica expresses a singular faith in beauty's power to move. From the steps outside, amidst hawkers and buskers, the city succumbs to countless daubs of gray in the dusk.
