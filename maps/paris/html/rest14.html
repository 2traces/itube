				<h1>Exclusive eels</h1>
				<p>It is a tradition in Japanese gastronomy: restaurants that specialise in one single product. In the case of the Nodaiwa, it is the eel. Kanjiro Kanemoto runs three such restaurants in Tokyo, as well as the Nodaiwa in Paris.  Iwajiro Noda was responsible for developing the cooking procedure for the highly nutritional fish. That was five generations ago, towards the end of the Edo era. The recipe has remained entirely unchanged ever since. Chef-de-cuisine Takeyuki Shirakura, from Tokyo, and his team of experts (they have all been trained in Japan) filet the 200 to 400-gramme fish as fresh as possible. The filets are then skewered and subjected to extreme heat, until all that is left in the fish is the vitamins and healthy fat. Afterwards, the filets are slowly steamed. Finally, the skewered fish is dunked three or four times in a soy-sauce and sweet-sake marinade, and grilled on glowing charcoal. To experience the fish disintegrating on your tongue after all this preparation constitutes a truly unique pleasure. Headwaiter Eric Ryckelynck (photo, together with Chef Takeyuki Shirakura) serves the filets in the classic manner: in a shiny black box on a bed of rice. The dish is then garnished with vegetables, and the eel liver swims in fish consomm√©. It is recommended that the meal be accompanied by Japanese beer, sake or French wine.<br><br><a href="preview://img/r14-1.jpg"><img src="img/r14-1.jpg" class="type1-img1"><br><br><a href="preview://img/r14-2.jpg"><img src="img/r14-2.jpg" class="type1-img1"> </div>
