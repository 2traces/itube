				<h1>A View of Notre-Dame</h1>
				<p>The large picture on the wall tiles of an idyllic street corner in the heart of old Paris shows La Bouteille d’Or’s historical side. The restaurant was built in 1630, and has managed to preserve its nostalgic charm to this day. Guests sit inside, above the Quai de Seine and under a half timbered ceiling. The décor is delightfully rustic. The terrace goes around the corner and leads to the winter garden at the Rue de Haut Pavé, with glass walls that are opened in the summer.  The back opens up to a stylish little salon, and a larger one located on the main floor, which is an ideal setting for private celebrations, receives guests with a cheerful atmosphere. The view, which goes through the old plane trees, over the Quai, and stops right at the Notre-Dame, is marvelous.  Although the restaurant is old, the patrons are not. Cécile Calistri, 27, runs the La Bouteille d’Or together with her husband, René. Madam is from Limoges, Monsieur orignated from the corsican harbour city of Bastia, and this mixed composition works well in the kitchen. Guests can select traditional French cuisine, like one of the most popular dishes, the 500 gram Sole Meunière. The classical corsican dishes on the menu at La Bouteille d’Or are tradition. The suckling pig with herbs from the Maquis (the typical Mediterranean shrublands located in Corsica) is delectible.  A parking service is available for guests who choose to come by car. <br><br><a href="preview://img/r3-1.jpg"><img src="img/r3-1.jpg" class="type1-img1"><br><br><a href="preview://img/r3-2.jpg"><img src="img/r3-2.jpg" class="type1-img1"> </div>
