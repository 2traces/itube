				<h1>Dining under the watch of Buddha</h1>
				<p>At the restaurant Chez Vong, Kaun Yin (the Chinese goddess of mercy and compassion) personally watches over all guests, making sure they all feel as comfortable as possible. The restaurant can be found right in the middle of the bustling quarter of Les Halles. The golden statue with numerous arms gives the Chinese gourmet restaurant its special flair. Established in 1980 by Mr. Vong, the restaurant has gone on to become one of the best of its kind in Paris. Numerous celebrities, from artists, fashion designers and economic and political heads have since enjoyed the aromatic and seasonal presentations prepared from the owner’s kitchen. Vai Kuan Vong, who was born in Macau, has held true to his Chinese roots. This can be experienced in his authentic Cantonese cuisine, as well as other regional delicacies. An example would be his main dish of glazed Peking duck, which is traditionally served in three courses (crispy skin, meat and bouillon). Recommendable as well is the Bresse-Poularde à la Vong, which also comes in three courses and represents one of the chef’s typical winter creations. Depending on the time of year, one can dine on streamed scallops served in the shell, “tipsy shrimps” as well as an accompaniment of fine French wines. Aside from his skill in the kitchen, the chef is also a masterful carver, which can be seen in his masterpiece: a “Happy Buddha” which is formed from 100 kilograms of frozen butter.<br><br><a href="preview://img/r12-1.jpg"><img src="img/r12-1.jpg" class="type1-img1"><br><br><a href="preview://img/r12-2.jpg"><img src="img/r12-2.jpg" class="type1-img1"> </div>
