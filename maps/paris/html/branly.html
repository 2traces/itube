				<p class="type1-scroll_2">The newest museum in Paris was built by star architect Jean Nouvel to house the state-owned collection of "non-Western" art, culled from several other venues. The exhibits mix artifacts from antiquity to the modern age, such as funeral masks from Melanesia, Siberian shaman drums, Indonesian textiles, and African statuary. A corkscrew ramp leads from the lobby to a cavernous exhibition space, which is color coded to designate sections from Asia, Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. The lighting is dim, sometimes too dim to read the information panels (which makes the €5 audioguide a good idea).<br>Renowned for his bold modern designs, Nouvel has said he wanted the museum to follow no rules—though many critics gave his vision a thumbs down when the museum opened in 2006. The exterior resembles a massive rust-color rectangle suspended on stilts. <img src="img/61.jpg" alt="" class="type1-img1"/>There are boxy shapes stuck to the facade facing the Seine, and louvered panels on the opposite side. The colors (dark reds, oranges, and yellows) are meant to evoke the tribal art within. A "living wall" comprised of some 150 species of exotic plants grows on the exterior, which is surrounded by a wild jungle garden with swampy patches—an impressive sight after dark when scores of cylindrical colored lights are illuminated. The name, strangely taken from the street address, is thought by many to be temporary until the museum is eventually rechristened in honor of its chief backer, former President Jacques Chirac. Feel like splurging? Les Ombres restaurant on the museum's fifth floor (separate entrance) has premier views of the Tour Eiffel—and prices to match. The budget-conscious can enjoy the garden at Le Café Branly on the ground floor.</p>
