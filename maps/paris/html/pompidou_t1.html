				<p class="type1-scroll">The Centre Pompidou was intended to handle 8,000 visitors a day. In its first two decades it attracted more than 145 million visitors, more than five times the number first predicted. As of 2011, more than 180 million people have visited the museum since its opening in 1977. However, until the 1997 renovation, 20 percent of the center's eight million annual visitors—in the main foreign tourists—rode the escalators up the outside of the building to the platform for the sights. In 2011, the museum saw an increase in attendance from 3.1 million (2010) to 3.6 million visitors.<br class="clear"><br class="clear"><img src="img/type1-img1.jpg" alt="" class="type1-img1"/>The Centre was designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano; British architect Richard Rogers; and Italian architect Gianfranco Franchini, assisted by Ove Arup & Partners. Reporting on Rogers' winning the Pritzker Prize in 2007, The New York Times noted that the design of the Centre "turned the architecture world upside down". The Pritzker jury said the Pompidou "revolutionized museums, transforming what had once been elite monuments into popular places of social and cultural exchange, woven into the heart of the city."</p>
