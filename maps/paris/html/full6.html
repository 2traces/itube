				<h1>Sainte-Chapelle</h1>
				<p>Built by the obsessively pious Louis IX (1226-70), this Gothic jewel is home to the oldest stained-glass windows in Paris. The chapel was constructed over three years, at phenomenal expense, to house the king's collection of relics acquired from the impoverished emperor of Constantinople. These included Christ's Crown of Thorns, fragments of the Cross, and drops of Christ's blood—though even in Louis's time these were considered of questionable authenticity. Some of the relics have survived and can be seen in the treasury of Notre-Dame, but most were lost during the Revolution.<br><br>
Highlights<br><br>The narrow spiral staircase by the entrance takes you to the upper chapel where the famed beauty of Sainte-Chapelle comes alive: 6,458 square feet of stained glass is delicately supported by painted stonework that seems to disappear in the colorful light streaming through the windows. Deep reds and blues dominate the background, noticeably different from later, lighter medieval styles such as those of Notre-Dame's rose windows.<br><br>The chapel is essentially an enormous magic lantern illuminating 1,130 figures from the Bible. Portions of the windows have been removed during a sweeping six-year restoration, set to finish in late 2014. (The lowest sections of the windows were restored in the mid-1800s.) Besides the dazzling glass, observe the detailed carvings on the columns and the statues of the apostles. The lower chapel is gloomy and plain, but take note of the low, vaulted ceiling decorated with fleurs-de-lis and cleverly arranged Ls for Louis.<br><br>Sunset is the optimal time to see the rose window; however, to avoid waiting in killer lines, plan your visit for a weekday morning, the earlier the better.<br><br>Come on a sunny day to appreciate the full effect of the light filtering through all of that glorious stained glass. You can buy a joint ticket with the Conciergerie: lines are shorter if you purchase it there, though you'll still have to go through a longish metal detector line to get into Sainte-Chapelle itself.<br><br>Sights aside, the chapel makes a divine setting for classical concerts; check the schedule at www.infoconcert.com.<br><br>Contact Information<br><br>Address: 4 bd. du Palais, Ile de la Cité, Paris, 75001<br><br>Phone: 01-53-40-60-97<br><br>Cost: €8.50; joint ticket with Conciergerie €12.50<br><br>Hours: Mar. 1--Oct. 31, daily 9:30--6; Nov.--Feb., daily 9--5</div>
