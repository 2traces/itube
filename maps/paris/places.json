            "text": "The most famous flea market in Paris is the one at Porte de Clignancourt, officially called Les Puces de Saint-Ouen, but known to everyone as Les Puces (The Fleas).  It covers seven hectares and is the largest antique market in the world, receiving between 120,000 to 180,000 visitors each weekend. If you get there early, plan on having a leisurely Cafe Creme and watching the antiques world start up for the day. If you're a serious shopper, watch out as it becomes very crowded after lunch!! We strongly recommend going to the Puces on Saturday or Sunday because many dealers aren't open on Monday, or only open by appointment.  If you can only shop on Monday, arrive in the morning when you stand a better chance of dealers being open, cleaning up after the weekend. Important Note: Be careful to hide wallets and purses; as in any city, big crowds are a great place for pickpockets to work - and the Flea Market is no exception. When guests reserve our apartments in Paris we repeatedly advise them to hide their wallets in a fanny pack and to leave their passports in our apartment safes, but every few months we get a phone call from them, telling us they have lost their passports and credit cards. Do be careful.",

Deyrolle was saved because of the extraordinary enthusiasm of so many of its fan including Hermes, numerous artists that worldwide contributed to realise piece artwork for an auction done by Christieís last November. As a result, the entomology room has been opened during the fall 2009. Today, the store is as beautiful as ever, with still collection of large mammals, magnificent mounted birds and other beautiful and astonishing natural wonders.",

The company is owned and operated by the Chauvin family, descendants of the eponymous Monsieur Berthillon, who opened the first store in 1954. Berthillon sells its ice cream in bulk and by the scoop from its shop on the island, but many other retailers in Paris sell its ice cream in cones and cups, and some grocers sell larger amounts. Berthillon's fame derives in part from its use of natural ingredients, with no chemical preservatives, artificial sweeteners or stabilizers. Its ice creams are made from only milk, sugar, cream and eggs. Flavourings derive from natural sources (cocoa, vanilla bean, fruit, etc.). Fifteen flavors are produced everyday by the chefs depending on the season, the availability at the market and the customer's demand. In total about sixty different flavors are produced by the Maison Berthillon throughout the year.",
